- 🧾 About Me - <h5 align="center"> Hello there, I'm Parth, a 20-year-old student currently studying at Chitkara University in Punjab. Let me share a bit about myself without sounding too full of myself.</h5>

<h5 align="center">I've always had a fascination with technology, particularly areas like IoT, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and gaming. It's been quite a journey exploring these interests, and along the way, I've managed to pick up a few certifications in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. My knowledge extends to networking, computers, cyber defense, and ethical hacking, which I find incredibly intriguing.</h5>

<h5 align="center">One thing I've been told about myself is that I'm pretty dedicated when it comes to tasks. Whether it's studying for exams or working on projects, I try to give it my all. People also say I have some leadership qualities, but honestly, I think it just comes from trying to stay grounded and level-headed, even when things get tough.</h5>

<h5 align="center">Communication is something I've been working on, trying to express myself clearly and effectively, especially when it comes to discussing technical stuff.</h5>

<h5 align="center">I'm far from perfect, and I know there's always more to learn. But I do try to approach problems with a sense of calmness and determination, no matter how challenging they may be.</h5>

<h5 align="center">So yeah, that's me – just a regular guy with a passion for technology, trying to stay grounded and keep learning along the way.</h5>
